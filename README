NAME
    texdirflatten - Collects all components of a (La)TeX file in a single
    output directory -- i.e., flattens its hierarchy.

SYNOPSIS
    texdirflatten [-1|--onetex] [-f|--file input.tex] [-o outputdir]

DESCRIPTION
    It parses the source file, following its included children (La)TeX files
    recursively, to collect together its components, such as graphics and
    BiBTeX bibliography files in different directories.

OPTIONS
    --file, -f *input.tex*
        Specifies input (La)TeX file.

    --onetex, -1
        If specified, produces a single TeX file by expanding all \input and
        \include commands in place.

    --output, -o *outputdir*
        Directory to collect all files. texdirflatten will copy each source
        file, graphics and bibliography file to this directory. It will be
        created if it is unexistent. If unspecified, it defaults to "flat/".

EXAMPLES
    The following example scans "manuscript.tex" in the current directory
    and gathers it and all its components in the "submit_01/" directory:

     $ texdirflatten -f manuscript.tex -o submit_01

    whatsoever provided.
